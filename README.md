# Machine-Learning-Final

Our primary contribution is the introduction of a cosine-decayed explicit regularization coefficient in Zhou’s matrix completion framework. Unlike Zhou’s fixed regularization, our dynamic schedule allows the penalty to decrease smoothly over time. We evaluate its effect under the Adam optimizer, examining stability, sensitivity to the choice of , and the ability to reach the target low-rank structure efficiently.
